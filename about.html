This is Godâ€™s primary means of building up Christians in their faith and reaching out with the good news of the gospel to those who do not know God.</p>

				  <p>Hounslow Christian fellowship is an Independent church, which means that we hold firmly to the historic teachings of the Christian faith, particularly the complete reliability and authority of the Bible.  </p>

<p>We are an non denominational church, which means that we are not part of a larger denomination.  However, we work wholeheartedly towards Christian Faith and belief.</p>

<p>We are a PREACHING & TEACHING church, which means that we believe our most important task is to accurately as possible exegete (interpret) and passionately preach from the Bible and to apply it to our lives today. </p>

<p>We are a MULTICULTURAL church, which means that we desire to see people from different cultural backgrounds come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour. Therefore because the majority of the congregation at this present time is Asian, we therefore have simultaneous translation during the service from English to Telugu . Most of our songs are in English,telugu but there are also Asian songs included in the service like hindi. However we are not an Asian church, we seek to reflect the mixed culture of the community of Hounslow, therefore we have Nepali and we do invite all as part of the congregation.</p>
 
 
<p>We are an independant church, which means that we believe the great task of the church is to make Jesus known to people from every tribe, tongue and nation. Therefore we have an active programme of local evangelism as well as Gospel out reach whole as a church across the Hounslow and Felltham areas  to pray for needy you can submit prayer request form over website ,our church will pray for you  and will contact you for needful prayers . </p>

				   <span></span> 
                  
				  <h4> GOD</h4>
<p>There is one God, who exists eternally in three distinct but equal persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God is unchangeable in his holiness, justice, wisdom and love. He is the Almighty Creator; Saviour and Judge who sustains and governs all things according to his sovereign will for his own glory.
</p>
<h4> THE BIBLE</h4>
<p>God has revealed himself in the Bible, which consists of the Old and New Testaments alone. Every word was inspired by God through human authors, so that the Bible as originally given is in its entirety the Word of God, without error and fully reliable in fact and doctrine. The Bible alone speaks with final authority and is always sufficient for all matters of belief and practice.
</p>
<h4>THE HUMAN RACE</h4>
<p>
All men and women, being created in the image of God, have inherent and equal dignity and worth. Their greatest purpose is to obey, worship and love God. As a result of the fall of our first parents, every aspect of human nature has been corrupted and all men and women are without spiritual life, guilty sinners and hostile to God. Every person is therefore under the just condemnation of God and needs to be born again, forgiven and reconciled to God in order to know and please him.
</p>
<h4>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST</h4>
<p> 
The Lord Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, and lived a sinless life in obedience to the Father. He taught with authority and all his words are true. On the cross he died in the place of sinners, bearing God's punishment for their sin, redeeming them by his blood. He rose from the dead and in his resurrection body ascended into heaven where he is exalted as Lord of all. He intercedes for his people in the presence of the Father.
</p>
<h4> SALVATION</h4>
<p>
Salvation is entirely a work of God's grace and cannot be earned or deserved. It has been accomplished by the Lord Jesus Christ and is offered to all in the gospel. God in his love forgives sinners whom he calls, granting them repentance and faith. All who believe in Christ are justified by faith alone, adopted into the family of God and receive eternal life.
</p>
<h4>THE HOLY SPIRIT</h4>

<p>The Holy Spirit has been sent from heaven to glorify Christ and to apply his work of salvation. He convicts sinners, imparts spiritual life and gives a true understanding of the Scriptures. He indwells all believers, brings assurance of salvation and produces increasing likeness to Christ. He builds up the Church and empowers its members for worship, service and mission.
</p>
<h4>THE CHURCH</h4>
<p> 
The universal Church is the body of which Christ is the head and to which all who are saved belong. It is made visible in local churches, which are congregations of believers who are committed to each other for the worship of God, the preaching of the Word, the administering of Baptism and the Lord's Supper; for pastoral care and discipline, and for evangelism. The unity of the body of Christ is expressed within and between churches by mutual love, care and encouragement. True fellowship between churches exists only where they are faithful to the gospel.
</p>
<h4>BAPTISM AND THE LORD'S SUPPER</h4>
<p>
Baptism and the Lord's Supper have been given to the church by Christ as visible signs of the gospel. Baptism is a symbol of union with Christ and entry into his Church but does not impart spiritual life. The Lord's Supper is a commemoration of Christ's sacrifice offered once for all and involves no change in the bread and wine. All its blessings are received by faith.
</p>
<h4>THE FUTURE</h4>
<p>
The Lord Jesus Christ will return in glory. He will raise the dead and judge the world in righteousness. The wicked will be sent to eternal punishment and the righteous will be welcomed into a life of eternal joy in fellowship with God. God will make all things new and will be glorified forever.</p>

				   <h3> Pastor Bro John Mark</h3>
				   <img src="img/jhon.JPG" />
                  
			<p>When someone looks at the website of a church they usually try to find out what it believes and what it's meetings are like. We have no constitution except the Bible. Neither do we belong to a denomination which has a constitution. Our church is independent,governed from within and not from without. In that wonderful Book,the Bible,is revealed God's great salvation plan for all mankind:Christ died for our sins and as the Lamb of God. He took our deserved punishment on Himself and so opened a way for sinful man to be saved by believing in His Son's completed work on our behalf on the Cross. His precious blood cleanses  from all sin (1 John 1:7-9).</p>
<p>Having received Christ as Lord and Saviour,the new believer is encouraged to be baptised in water. We would expect to see the following changes in the new believer:</p>
<p>Firstly, to have a love for the Lord Jesus Who first loved us (1 John 4:19) and that the love we have for Him should create in us a love for our fellow-believers.</p>				  
	<p>Secondly, he should know the Lordship,Kingship and Headship of the Lord Jesus Christ in His life. Simply put, this means obedience.Also he should have a desire to obey God's Word, the Bible.</p>
	<p>Thirdly, he should have a desire to pray. We recommend having three specific times in the day for prayer:morning,midday and evening (Psa 55:17, Dan 6:10), the morning quiet time being the most important. All believers should get up early and spend an hour on their knees in prayer and Bible reading before they start their day (Psalms 63:1,Mark 1:35,Psalms 5:3). We also encourage believers, from the start, to learn to worship the Lord. This gives the believer an exalted and glorious vision of God, the high and lofty One Who inhabits eternity (Isa 57:15) and in our Lord's Day meetings, after a short message, we give an opportunity for all believers to offer their personal worship (Heb 13:15). By worshiping,believers grow spiritually.</p>
